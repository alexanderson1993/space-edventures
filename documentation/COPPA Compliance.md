# COPPA Compliance

The Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a US law that protects the privacy of children under the age of thirteen online. Since Space EdVentures intends to collect personally identifying information of students that may be under the age of thirteen, it must comply with COPPA. Because Space EdVentures shares student iThere are a few requirements which this site meets:

- All persons registering for Space EdVentures must first disclose their birthdate, which is not considered personally identifying information. If the user is 13 or older, the site will allow them to sign in without parental verification. Otherwise, the user will go through a parental verification process. Their account will be locked until the rest of the process is complete.
- The user will be asked for the email address of a parent or legal guardian. An email will be sent by the service to that email address explaining the app, what data is collected, and how it is used. They will be directed to a page on the website where they can verify their identity.
- The site will require two or three verifications:
  - A photo upload and a an upload of an image of their drivers license or photo id (photos are deleted after verification).
  - An entry to type in their credit card information, which will be verified by Stripe.
  - A form where they can sign at the bottom.
- In the event it is determined that we are not sharing information publicly or with third parties (Space Center directors), alternative verification methods can be used:
  - In the first email sent to the parent, we ask them to respond with consent. This could be done through a page on the website or through email replies.
  - After a month, another email is sent confirming confirmation.
