- List of possible missions, simulators, space centers, and stations that the
  participant has done and what they can still do
- Blog posts from space center directors/employees
- Starfleet Database with library entries about the universe, spaceships,
  aliens, missions, etc. Include actual curriculum points. One separate portal
  for each universe - Star Trek, Farpoint, etc
- Social feature - invite friends to a list, send them messages in the app, see
  updates on what recent missions their friends have done, include photo uploads
- a "Post-to-Facebook" type feature where they can post a blurb and image to
  their social media account about something they did
- Notifications of new content (new missions/badges/space centers)
- BuzzFeed/Pottermore style Quizzes - Which spaceship are you? What position are
  you most like?
- Forum feature? Asking questions, discussions, etc.
- Crew Finder - find people willing to do a space mission. Be able to schedule
  and connect with people. Discounts?
- Some way to subscribe to text/email notifications about messages or content,
  or crew joining their group
