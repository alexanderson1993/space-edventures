# Alex's Notes

- [ ] Make it possible to send an email with the redemption token from Thorium (this is allowed under COPPA)
- [ ] Make sure it properly redirects the user once they've registered a center.
- [x] Clean up the queries in Thorium so it isn't reloading every render
- [ ] Make it possible to add extra crew to a Thorium space edventures flight, like the captain/admiral
