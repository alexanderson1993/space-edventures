# Alex's Notes

- [x] Make it possible to send an email with the redemption token from Thorium (this is allowed under COPPA)
- [x] Make sure users are properly signed in if they are both a Space EdVentuers user and submit a flight record with an email.
- [x] Make sure it properly redirects the user once they've registered a center.
- [x] Clean up the queries in Thorium so it isn't reloading every render
- [x] Make it possible to add extra crew to a Thorium space edventures flight, like the captain/admiral
- [x] Make sure user accounts are truly locked during COPPA verification
