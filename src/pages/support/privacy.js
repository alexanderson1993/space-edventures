      <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. It is Fyreworks LLC's policy to respect
        your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across
        our website,
        <a href="https://spaceedventures.org">https://spaceedventures.org</a>,
        and other sites we own and operate.

        We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a
        service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your

        <strong>Children's Information</strong>
        <br />
        We believe it is important to provide added protection for children
        online. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with
        their children to observe, participate in and/or monitor and guide their
        online activity. By design, Space EdVentures might collect information
        from children under 13. We intentionally require users to provide a
        birth date so we can verify their age. In the event that someone
        provides a birth date that indicates they are younger than 13, their
        account is immediately locked until a parent provides proof of their
        consent for their child to continue using the website. If a parent or
        guardian believes that spaceedventures.org has in its database the
        personally-identifiable information of a child under the age of 13,
        please contact us immediately at
        <a href="mailto:hello@spaceedventures.org">
          hello@spaceedventures.org
        </a>{" "}
        and we will use our best efforts to promptly remove such information
        from our records.

      <p>
        We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide
        you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect
        within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well
        as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

        We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with
        third-parties, except when required to by law.
